# plugin.video.yourtube
putting the 'you' back in youtube

The purpose of this addon is to integrate youtube subscriptions into your Kodi library as though they were TV Shows. It works by generating a tvshow.nfo and episode .nfo's for subscriptions and their uploads.

### Features
Currently the addon will scrape every youtube subscription and turn them into single-season TV Shows with an Episode for every video.

### Planned Features
 - Merging multiple channels into a single TV Show, i.e. Numberphile + Numberphile2 -> Numberphile
 - Splitting channels into multiple TV Shows
 - Merging multiple videos into a single Episode, i.e. Title Part 1 + Title Part 2 + ... + Title Part n -> Title
 - User-defined Seasons
